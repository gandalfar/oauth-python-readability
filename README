Unofficial Readability Python library
--

This project is based on work of Konpaku Kogasa http://code.google.com/p/oauth-python-twitter2/
and provides a partial python wrapper for https://www.readability.com/publishers/api/

For now just addBookmark and getBookmarks() are implemented.

See sample.py to learn how to use it.
